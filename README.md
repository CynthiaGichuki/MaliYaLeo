## Introduction  

In Kenya, market prices for key food commodities fluctuate due to seasonal changes, weather patterns, transportation costs and middlemen influence. Farmers, traders and households struggle to access reliable, real-time information which limits their ability to make informed decisions.  

**MaliYaLeo** is a **data-driven solution** that provides:

-  Real-time and forecasted market prices.  
-  Predictive insights for 7â€“30 days ahead.  
-  Accessible delivery via **USSD, SMS, and Web Dashboard**  reaching even rural farmers with no smartphones or internet.

## Problem Statement  

- Farmers are vulnerable to exploitation due to lack of price transparency.  
- Households and traders face uncertainty in budgeting and purchasing decisions.  
- Current price reporting systems are often delayed or not user-friendly.

##  Business Objectives

**1. Provide Real-Time Market Price Information** â€“ build a centralized data system to collect, clean and display up-to-date prices.  
**2. Predict Future Price Trends** â€“ use ML models (Ridge Regresision,Prophet, XGBoost, LSTM) to forecast prices for better planning.  
**3. Deliver Insights via Inclusive Channels** â€“ deploy to USSD, SMS and Web Dashboard for broad accessibility.  

## Dataset 

**DATASOURCE:**  

The dataset compiles historical market price data from KAMIS by Kilimo, an official Kenyan Government platform managed by the Ministry of Agriculture.  
[KAMIS Market Prices](https://kamis.kilimo.go.ke/site/market)
  
It includes daily and weekly wholesale & retail prices for a wide range of commodities across Kenyan markets.  This table contains a total of 63173 records and is structured with the following key columns

##  Project Approach  
**1. Data Pipeline** â€“ Collected, cleaned and merged market datasets.  
**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Identified trends, seasonality and anomalies.[**Download EDA script**](https://github.com/CynthiaGichuki/MaliYaLeo/blob/EDA/EDA_final.ipynb)
**3. Modeling** â€“ Built and compared:  
   - Baseline Ridge Regression
   - Prophet (Time Series)
   - LSTM Neural Network
   - XGBoost
**4. Deployment Prep** â€“ Exported `.pkl` models, designed database schema, created API endpoints.  
**5. Channels** â€“ Web dashboard, USSD and SMS (Africaâ€™s Talking).  


## Database Structure & Initial Checks

The **MaliYaLeo** system uses **PostgreSQL** as its main database. The schema currently consists of **4 core tables**:

* **market\_data** â€“ Stores historical market prices for key commodities.
* **predictions** â€“ Contains machine learningâ€“generated price forecasts.
* **users** â€“ Logs all user interactions via USSD, SMS, and web requests.
* **system\_logs** â€“ Tracks API events, system messages, and errors.

Before modeling and analysis several data quality checks and cleaning steps were performed on the raw KAMIS dataset to ensure consistency and accuracy:

1. Dropped SupplyVolume â€“ it was empty.
2. Filled missing prices â€“ used median for WholesaleUnitPrice & RetailUnitPrice.
3. Created ReferencePrice â€“ avg of wholesale & retail.
4. Standardized text â€“ fixed casing & typos in Classification, Market and County.
5. Cleaned dates â€“ ensured Date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
6. Removed duplicates â€“ kept only clean, unique records.
7. Removed outliers â€“ filtered unrealistic price points for accuracy.

## Executive Summary  

###  Overview of Findings  

* Commodity prices follow clear seasonal patterns peaking around harvest and planting periods.
* XGBoost emerged as the best model predicting 7â€“30 day prices with RÂ² > 0.88 enabling actionable planning for farmers and traders.
* USSD & SMS channels widen access  ensuring even rural users without smartphones benefit.

### Modeling Overview

We tested multiple approaches to forecast prices:

| Model              | Wholesale MSE | Wholesale RÂ² | Retail MSE | Retail RÂ² |
|--------------------|--------------:|-------------:|-----------:|----------:|
| Ridge Regression   | ðŸŸ¡ 500.84     | ðŸŸ¡ 0.7850    | ðŸŸ¡ 704.32  | ðŸŸ¡ 0.7790  |
| Prophet            | ðŸ”´ 26.76      | ðŸ”´ 0.0865    | ðŸ”´ 16.98   | ðŸ”´ -0.0656 |
| LSTM Neural Net    | ðŸŸ¡ â€“          | ðŸŸ¡ 0.5850    | ðŸŸ¡ â€“       | ðŸŸ¡ â€“       |
| **XGBoost**        | ðŸŸ¢ **259.87** | ðŸŸ¢ **0.8884**| ðŸŸ¢ **352.44**| ðŸŸ¢ **0.8894** |

 **Legend**:  
ðŸŸ¢ **Best performing model** â€“ Lowest MSE & highest RÂ²  
ðŸŸ¡ **Moderate performance** â€“ Acceptable but not optimal  
ðŸ”´ **Poor performance** â€“ Underperformed in tests

**Key takeaway:** 

XGBoost delivers reliable, short-term price forecasts to support smarter market decisions.

##  Insights Deep Dive  

### **1: Price Transparency**

* Retail prices are always higher than wholesale across all commodities and counties.
* Perishables (e.g. avocados) show the biggest markups while low-risk goods (e.g. tea) have smaller ones.
* Increased visibility exposes middlemen margins giving farmers leverage in negotiations.


![Retail_Wholesale Graph](https://github.com/CynthiaGichuki/MaliYaLeo/blob/EDA/Images/Retail_Wholesale_Graph.png)  

### **2: Predictive Planning**

* XGBoost predicts prices 7â€“30 days ahead helping farmers and traders plan before shifts hit the market.

* Seasonal patterns are clear as prices drop in Augâ€“Sept (harvest season) and spike in Octâ€“Nov (pre-holiday demand).

* Retail prices remain steady while wholesale prices swing more showing how retailers absorb volatility for consumers.

### **3: Regional Disparities**

*  **National price gap**:

  * **Kiambu (highest) = 140â€¯KES, Isiolo (lowest): 35â€¯KES**

$$
\text{Gap} = \frac{(140 - 35)}{140} \times 100 = \mathbf{75\%}
$$

Farmers in Isiolo pay **75% less** than those in Kiambu for the same goods.


*  **Regional price gap** (within a single region or cluster of counties):

 **Top county = 120â€¯KES, Lowest county = 90â€¯KES**

$$
\text{Gap} = \frac{(120 - 90)}{120} \times 100 = \mathbf{25\%}
$$

Even within the same region buyers face up to 25% variation in prices.


  * High-price counties (Kiambu, Nairobi) have bigger markups hence higher profit margins.
  * Lower-price counties (Isiolo, Bomet) have thin margins leaving sellers more vulnerable to market shocks.



### **4: Access & Inclusivity**

* Over **77% of rural users depend on mobile money services** (e.g. Mâ€‘Pesa), based on **FinAccess 2024 data** ([thekenyatimes.com][1]).
* Most of this activity is conducted over **USSD** since rural areas have lower smartphone ownership and limited internet access ([businessdailyafrica.com][2], [businessdailyafrica.com][3]).

* This confirms that USSD/SMS channels will provide essential access for rural and underserved users.


## Recommendations  
Based on the insights, we recommend:  

* With predictive price insights now available farmers should align harvest and selling schedules to take advantage of peak market prices.

* Encourage households to use price forecasts for better monthly budgeting like buying in bulk during price dips ( Augâ€“Sept) and planning grocery spending ahead of seasonal spikes.

* Push for wider dashboard adoption by government agencies to guide subsidy allocation, food security measures and market stabilization policies.

* Look to optimize logistics and supply chains by leveraging county-level price forecasts enabling traders to reduce transport costs and avoid oversupply in low-demand regions.

* Establish expansion plans for commodity coverage by  adding emerging high-value crops like avocados and macadamia to meet evolving market demand.
  

## Assumptions & Caveats  

- Weather patterns were not sourced from a formal dataset instead, general knowledge of Kenyaâ€™s seasonal climate (harvest & planting seasons) was applied when interpreting price trends.
- Some market price anomalies were capped at 99th percentile to handle outliers.  
- Forecast accuracy is highest for 7â€“14 days uncertainty increases past 30 days.  


##  Next Steps  

* Add more contextual features like integrate transport costs, inflation data, weather insights and supply volume to improve model accuracy.
* Scale the model to other East African markets  extend beyond Kenya for regional price forecasting.


## **Future Enhancements (Long-Term)**

* Deploy an API & web dashboard to provide real-time price data access for farmers, traders and policymakers.
* Launch USSD & SMS service via Africaâ€™s Talking  to ensure rural farmers without smartphones can access price forecasts.
